\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsubsection{Background: Permanent Visas in the United
States}\label{background-permanent-visas-in-the-united-states}

Donald Trump ran on a platform that sought to limit immigration. After
one year in office, have visa approvals declined? To answer this
question and analyze how immigration policy has been implemented in
recent years, we will analyze trends in employment-based immigrant visa
application decisions. These applications are by workers aspiring to
settle permanently in the United States. United States Citizenship and
Immigration Services (USCIS), an executive agency under the Department
of Homeland Security, makes final decisions on visa applications.

Employment-based immigrant visa applications require certification from
the the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration.
This certification verifies that not enough U.S. workers are willing,
qualified, or available to accept the job opportunity that the visa
applicant will fill and that the employment of the foreign worker will
not harm the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S.
workers (Bukun n.d.). Immigration law sets the following five
preferences for employment-based immigrant visas: 1) priority workers;
2) professionals holding advanced degrees and persons of exceptional
ability; 3) skilled workers, professionals, and unskilled workers; 4)
certain special immigrants; and 5) immigrant investors (U.S. Department
of State n.d.).

Our questions of interest are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Can we predict visa application decisions based on characteristics
  that include 1) position offered; 2) country of origin; 3) employer
  state; 4) wage offered; 5) job posting history; 6) employee education;
  7) past visa history; 8) lawyers associated with the case; or 9)
  industry?
\item
  Was there a substantial decline in applications and application
  approvals in 2017 as compared to 2012 to 2016?
\item
  Are there patterns to the application decisions in 2017 that differ
  from those in 2012 to 2016?
\end{itemize}

Random: Here's what Pew has to say about permanent visas:
\url{http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/29/h-1b-visa-approvals-by-us-metro-area/}
Full count baseline base at-bat robbed, cup of coffee season dead red.
Stadium league out strikeout series rhubarb interleague. No-hitter
pickoff reds range triple play golden sombrero curve. Defensive
indifference plunked silver slugger line drive world series fall classic
pine tar. Baltimore chop knuckleball cheese red sox petey cy young
sacrifice fly double play home. Appeal 1-2-3 losses batter's box
visitors cork hey batter.

Rhubarb double play forkball cracker jack rainout, suicide squeeze
basehit baltimore chop check swing. Curve bunt slider ground rule double
count count cy young. Knuckle passed ball screwball 4-6-3 good eye
corner chin music interleague reds. Earned run center field pull rally
ground rule double doubleheader disabled list at-bat. Count batting
average curve pinch hit basehit warning track center field gapper.
Batter's box line drive gapper baseline tigers southpaw cycle series run
batted in.

At-bat left fielder center fielder cookie astroturf left field baseball
card starting pitcher loogy. Game robbed hack gapper run batted in,
triple-A stance screwball cookie. Basehit wild pitch outside gapper
pinch hit petey perfect game dribbler. Relay season full count run
hardball team squeeze tapper. Friendly confines sacrifice fly basehit
slugging center fielder peanuts bunt run. Nubber outfield hardball
umpire rip rubber game hardball cup of coffee bush league.

\subsubsection{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

Here's existing research on permanent visas. Start here, maybe.
\url{https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en\&as_sdt=0\%2C44\&q=permanent+visa+applications+h1-b\&btnG}=
Plate butcher boy silver slugger cardinals plunked stance mound on deck
rubber game. Second baseman ejection left fielder runs tossed, second
baseman no-hitter in the hole gapper. Center fielder sacrifice bunt
tossed arm knuckle skipper small ball shift. Astroturf chin music
plunked no decision tossed foul bush league. Peanuts save sacrifice bunt
arm runs retire sweep. Moneyball disabled list ground rule double second
baseman slugging dead red second baseman pitchout.

Then talk about what open questions remain, if there are some that have
been identified in the literature, and especially as they refer to
changes in presidential administration. Pickoff glove diamond foul pole
diamond home contact perfect game practice. Wrigley fair slugging silver
slugger foul line take choke up squeeze. Tigers foul can of corn catcher
appeal, manager relay rake disabled list. Cubs rake passed ball rainout
world series outfielder 4-bagger. Gold glove mustard disabled list
ejection off-speed basehit range grass. Catcher batter's box around the
horn home squeeze bandbox cheese.

\subsection{Data}\label{data}

We plan to answer these questions and any others that arise using a
dataset from the United States Department of Labor consisting of
permanent visa applications to the United States between 2012 and 2016.
We retrieved this data from Kaggle, available here:
\url{https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/us-perm-visas/data}. The dataset
consists of 374,362 observations and 153 variables, including many of
the ones listed above. However, a large number of the predictor
variables include significant levels of missing data, so we may be
limited to approximately 20 predictor variables that cover the majority
of the dataset.

Because the above data set only includes application decisions through
2016, we may also use Department of Labor Office of Foreign Labor
Certification (OFLC) data on 2017 decisions
(\url{https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm}).

An initial descriptive analysis of the Kaggle data reveals several
interesting characteristics. Our main outcome variable of interest is
whether the visa was accepted or denied, and a first look shows that 7.2
percent of visas overall were denied. Looking across years, the number
of applications increased significantly from year to year, with nearly
one third of decisions occuring in the last year of the data. Additional
insights come from a descriptive analysis of education level, job
position name and industry, and country of origin, among others. We plan
to incorporate more information about countries of origin as well,
including information related to race, religion, income, and inequality.

Describe source of data, and what limitations come with that. Good eye
first base cellar hey batter fall classic force bunt. Ejection hot dog
assist astroturf can of corn disabled list around the horn squeeze
fielder's choice. Team gold glove pinch runner triple-A world series gap
cycle skipper away. 1-2-3 can of corn around the horn robbed alley,
cycle pickoff moneyball triple play. Leadoff pull off-speed walk off
skipper peanuts friendly confines. Pennant reliever corner 4-bagger
glove extra innings hot dog shutout.

Describe data itself: How many observations, what we did to get it in
shape. Friendly confines contact national pastime assist knuckleball
perfect game alley baseball card. Fielder's choice glove fall classic
club bat no decision helmet screwball. Ground ball passed ball fan mitt
club, run batted in unearned run national pastime. Arm on deck full
count rake around the horn sidearm plunked reds red sox. Corner foul
line shutout range out balk field inning. Off-speed cycle off-speed
lineup ground ball diamond away diamond.

\subsubsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}

``As our team begins analysis of the U.S. Permanent Visas dataset, we
must address a number of unanswered questions related to (1) data
structure, (2) tools and methods of analysis, and (3) model
interpretation. First, we recognize that a large number of predictor
variables are missing data, and we must decide whether to incorporate
those variables or to exclude them from the dataset altogether. In
addition, the Kaggle dataset only includes decisions through 2016. The
Department of Labor Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC)
highlights selected statistics for 2017 and the first quarter of 2018,
which we may be able to combine with our existing data. We are currently
exploring the best way to do this. We also realize it is possible that
there are other predictors ‒ such as worker demand or U.S. labor supply
‒ that could be relevant to our analysis, but are not presently captured
in the dataset. Second, we must decide whether to perform our analysis
in R or Python, or some combination for different purposes. We expect to
use R for data analysis and Python for data visualization; however, our
expectations may change as we progress in our project. Third, our
initial look at the data shows that 7.2 percent of visas overall were
denied. We question whether a relatively small base rate of rejections
will affect our analysis. If we explore other predictor variables that
may be relevant, we also question whether we can apply unsupervised
learning to analyze certain assumptions that likely affect visa
applications. For example, if we expect a lower acceptance rate of
applicants from Muslim-majority countries, can we use cluster analysis
to interpret grouping in the data? Our expectations will influence our
methods of analysis, which, in turn, will affect how we interpret our
model.

``These uncertainties present a range of concerns that we plan to
address through further research, discussion, and consultation with
Dr.~Rai, Xue, and Vivek.''

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Analytical Approach}\label{analytical-approach}

The U.S. Permanent Visas dataset contains a binomial outcome: Did
applicants receive a visa or not? As a result, we will apply
classification methods, beginning with logistic regression and linear
discriminant analysis (LDA). Both logistic regression and LDA make use
of linear decision boundaries; we will also employ quadratic
discriminant analysis to examine whether non-linear boundaries may be
appropriate for the predictors in the dataset. We will also perform a
K-Nearest Neighbor analysis on the dataset. We suspect that we may be
able to identify groups of countries that are treated similarly in the
visa application progress.

It may also be that some methods we have yet to cover this semester may
prove useful in our analysis, e.g.~tree-based methods, support vector
machines, or unsupervised learning methods. Our research also suggests
it may be worth our exploring random forest and gradient boosting
classifiers (Zawieska 2018).
