## Introduction 
### Background: Permanent Visas in the United States  
_This is the hook, pulling from news sources and the history of permanent visas. Next steps: Resarch and write. Start here, maybe:_

* http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/29/h-1b-visa-approvals-by-us-metro-area/ 

"Donald Trump ran on a platform that sought to limit immigration. After one year in office, have visa approvals declined? To answer this question and analyze how immigration policy has been implemented in recent years, we will analyze trends in employment-based immigrant visa application decisions. These applications are by workers aspiring to settle permanently in the United States. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an executive agency under the Department of Homeland Security, makes final decisions on visa applications. 

"Employment-based immigrant visa applications require certification from the the Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration. This certification verifies that not enough U.S. workers are willing, qualified, or available to accept the job opportunity that the visa applicant will fill and that the employment of the foreign worker will not harm the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers (Bukun n.d.). Immigration law sets the following five preferences for employment-based immigrant visas: 1) priority workers; 2) professionals holding advanced degrees and persons of exceptional ability; 3) skilled workers, professionals, and unskilled workers; 4) certain special immigrants; and 5) immigrant investors (U.S. Department of State n.d.).

"Our questions of interest are the following:

* Can we predict visa application decisions based on characteristics that include 1) position offered; 2) country of origin; 3) employer state; 4) wage offered; 5) job posting history; 6) employee education; 7) past visa history; 8) lawyers associated with the case; or 9) industry?
* Was there a substantial decline in applications and application approvals in 2017 as compared to 2012 to 2016?
* Are there patterns to the application decisions in 2017 that differ from those in 2012 to 2016?

Full count baseline base at-bat robbed, cup of coffee season dead red. Stadium league out strikeout series rhubarb interleague. No-hitter pickoff reds range triple play golden sombrero curve. Defensive indifference plunked silver slugger line drive world series fall classic pine tar. Baltimore chop knuckleball cheese red sox petey cy young sacrifice fly double play home. Appeal 1-2-3 losses batter's box visitors cork hey batter.

Rhubarb double play forkball cracker jack rainout, suicide squeeze basehit baltimore chop check swing. Curve bunt slider ground rule double count count cy young. Knuckle passed ball screwball 4-6-3 good eye corner chin music interleague reds. Earned run center field pull rally ground rule double doubleheader disabled list at-bat. Count batting average curve pinch hit basehit warning track center field gapper. Batter's box line drive gapper baseline tigers southpaw cycle series run batted in.

Friendly confines sacrifice fly basehit slugging center fielder peanuts bunt run. Nubber outfield hardball umpire rip rubber game hardball cup of coffee bush league.

### Literature Review 
_This section should include what other (academic) work has been done on this topic. Next step: Read and write. Start here, maybe._ https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44&q=permanent+visa+applications+h1-b&btnG=

Plate butcher boy silver slugger cardinals plunked stance mound on deck rubber game. Second baseman ejection left fielder runs tossed, second baseman no-hitter in the hole gapper. Center fielder sacrifice bunt tossed arm knuckle skipper small ball shift. Astroturf chin music plunked no decision tossed foul bush league. Peanuts save sacrifice bunt arm runs retire sweep. Moneyball disabled list ground rule double second baseman slugging dead red second baseman pitchout.

Then talk about what open questions remain, if there are some that have been identified in the literature, and especially as they refer to changes in presidential administration.  Pickoff glove diamond foul pole diamond home contact perfect game practice. Wrigley fair slugging silver slugger foul line take choke up squeeze. Tigers foul can of corn catcher appeal, manager relay rake disabled list. Cubs rake passed ball rainout world series outfielder 4-bagger. Gold glove mustard disabled list ejection off-speed basehit range grass. Catcher batter's box around the horn home squeeze bandbox cheese.

## Data 
_This is where we'll describe the dataset, what we did to it, what other data sets we appended. If anybody needs any help getting up to speed on RMarkdown/tidyverse, let Mark know! Next steps:_

In order to answer these questions, we make use of a novel dataset constructed from multiple sources. The primary dataset binds together permament visa application data from the United States Department of Labor 2008 to 2018. That combined dataset contains ??????? observations and _p=153_ variables. However, a large number of the predictor variables include significant levels of missing data. We limit this analysis to 20 predictor variables that cover the majority of the dataset: 

* Case Status (our dependent variable)
* Case Number 
* Class of admission
* Country of origin
* Decision date
* Employer Name, City, State, and Zip
* Job City and State
* NAICS Code and Title 
* Wage "offer "Offer from" and "Offer to"
* Prevailing wage Job Title, Level, SOC Code, Amount, and Unit of Pay 

After cleaning data (See Appendix B) and removing applications withdrawn by the applicants, the remaining dataset includes _n=378,696_ observations. 

```{r plot of applications over time and original case status, include=FALSE}
# List of variables for the paragraph above 
# ls(newdata_no_typo_wages)

# Cleaning and plotting over time 
visas$year <- year(visas$decision_date)
overtime <- ggplot(visas, aes(year)) + geom_bar(stat="count", aes(fill=case_status)) + labs(list(title='US Permenent Visa Applications', x='Year', y=''))
```

```{r applications over time, echo=FALSE}
overtime
```

To that dataset, we added the following data about the applicant's country of origin: 

* Total population and GDP per capita 
* Unemployment
* Migration per capita and Net migration
* Percent Muslim population 

For each of these values we use data from 2012 (??????), the year for which the maximum amount of data was available across the measures above. 

_Notes and questions:_

* Are there any systematic patterns in the "withdrawn" data that we should be considering?
* Is it worth figuring out how to add longitudinal country data? 
* Should we do basic variable explanation here?

"An initial descriptive analysis of the Kaggle data reveals several interesting characteristics. Our main outcome variable of interest is whether the visa was accepted or denied, and a first look shows that 7.2 percent of visas overall were denied. Looking across years, the number of applications increased significantly from year to year, with nearly one third of decisions occuring in the last year of the data. 

```{r ISL analysis, include=FALSE}
# See p.42 in ISL. 

# pairs(Auto)
# pairs(∼ mpg + displacement + horsepower + weight + acceleration , Auto)
# This probably doesn't work for us, because of all the non-numberic, non-continuous variables. 

summary(visas)
# First glance suggests there might be something wrong with some of the wage data.

```


### Limitations
_Add stuff here as we find problems with the dataset/have to make decisions about what to include/discard._
"As our team begins analysis of the U.S. Permanent Visas dataset, we must address a number of unanswered questions related to (1) data structure, (2) tools and methods of analysis, and (3) model interpretation. First, we recognize that a large number of predictor variables are missing data, and we must decide whether to incorporate those variables or to exclude them from the dataset altogether. In addition, the Kaggle dataset only includes decisions through 2016. The Department of Labor Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) highlights selected statistics for 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, which we may be able to combine with our existing data. We are currently exploring the best way to do this. We also realize it is possible that there are other predictors ‒ such as worker demand or U.S. labor supply ‒ that could be relevant to our analysis, but are not presently captured in the dataset. Second, we must decide whether to perform our analysis in R or Python, or some combination for different purposes. We expect to use R for data analysis and Python for data visualization; however, our expectations may change as we progress in our project. Third, our initial look at the data shows that 7.2 percent of visas overall were denied. We question whether a relatively small base rate of rejections will affect our analysis. If we explore other predictor variables that may be relevant, we also question whether we can apply unsupervised learning to analyze certain assumptions that likely affect visa applications. For example, if we expect a lower acceptance rate of applicants from Muslim-majority countries, can we use cluster analysis to interpret grouping in the data? Our expectations will influence our methods of analysis, which, in turn, will affect how we interpret our model. 

"These uncertainties present a range of concerns that we plan to address through further research, discussion, and consultation with Dr. Rai, Xue, and Vivek."

## Analytical Approach 
_This will explain which methods we use and why. Next steps: Add more detail, then start running models and cross-validating them._
"The U.S. Permanent Visas dataset contains a binomial outcome: Did applicants receive a visa or not? As a result, we will apply classification methods, beginning with logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Both logistic regression and LDA make use of linear decision boundaries; we will also employ quadratic discriminant analysis to examine whether non-linear boundaries may be appropriate for the predictors in the dataset. We will also perform a K-Nearest Neighbor analysis on the dataset. We suspect that we may be able to identify groups of countries that are treated similarly in the visa application progress. 

"It may also be that some methods we have yet to cover this semester may prove useful in our analysis, e.g. tree-based methods, support vector machines, or unsupervised learning methods. Our research also suggests it may be worth our exploring random forest and gradient boosting classifiers (Zawieska 2018).
